    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
    <p>
      At Florals, we believe flowers are more than just gifts—they're expressions of love, joy, and gratitude.
      For over a decade, we have been crafting floral experiences for weddings, anniversaries, and everyday surprises.
      Every bouquet is hand-arranged with care and delivered with love.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our passion is rooted in nature and nurtured by our customers smiles. Whether you're celebrating something big or simply brightening a day,
      Florals is here to make it beautiful.
    </p>

    <p>
       We harbor the gift of giving. Our flowers are carefully plucked and grown in the best conditions to ensure they are healthy 
       and far from chemical growth. Our organic flowers pose no threat to the environment and can further be recycled and used in home
       agriculture.  
    </p>

    <p>Florals is a boutique flower shop dedicated to bringing beauty, elegance, and joy through handcrafted floral arrangements.
       Whether it’s a romantic bouquet, a cheerful gift, or a touch of nature for your home, our fresh flowers and thoughtful designs 
       are perfect for any occasion. We believe in the power of flowers to brighten moments and create lasting memories.
    </p>

    <p>At Florals, we take pride in fostering meaningful connections—with our community, our growers, and the environment.
      We partner with local farms and artisans to support sustainable practices and fair trade, ensuring every purchase not
      only brings happiness to your doorstep but also uplifts those who help make it possible. From seed to stem, every detail is a
      testament to our commitment to quality, sustainability, and heartfelt service.
